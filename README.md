### Problem Context:
To help city residents commute easily and effectively, NYC MTA offers different kinds of 24 hour services such as local, limited-stop, select bus and express [1]. They even launched 
This paper starts off with discussing the importance of accurate prediction of Bus arrival time in cities where residents heavily relies on public transportation. With advancement in Information and Communication Technologies, use of real-time data in accurately predicting bus arrival time are widely applied with the hope to improve the operational efficiency. Some of the algorithms that have been developed include elementary approaches like simple average, linear regression, non-parametric regressions and k-Nearest neighbors. These simple algorithms are computationally inefficient. Other advanced approach includes moving average models, Kalman filter, Support Vector Machine Models (SVM), Exponential Smoothing (ES) Models, Artificial Neural Network (Effects across Space). The models discussed in the literature review falls short of capturing the cyclic variation in traffic data like the time of day or day of week also the effect of weather on traffic. In this paper the authors are proposing a model that can account of the changing condition both in short and long term.
