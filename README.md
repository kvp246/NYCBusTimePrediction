### Problem Context:
NYC MTA Bus agency boasts of largest network of public buses than any other public agency in North America. The bus services are offered 24 hours a day and includes different kinds such as local, limited-stop, select bus and express to help city residents commute easily and effectively [1]. In middle of 2015, NYC Bus MTA agency launched a new Bus Time service that provides time-based bus arrival estimates in addition to distance-based information at any given stop citywide. Surely this kind of system which provides prediction of Bus arrival time especially in NYC where city residents heavily rely on public transportation, and this kind of predictive information before hand helps them to plan their trips more efficiently. Bus Time service is possible due to the advancements in Information and Communication Technologies and it uses location data provided by an enhanced global positioning device mounted inside each bus which is further integrated with bus route info, schedules and map files to output the information received by bus customers [2]. On the other hand, according to the NYC's Comptroller audit report on MTA Bus operations, almost 30% of the time the city's express services are late. Additionally, majority of bus complaints made by the customers are due to lateness and delays as shown in the below image [3].

However, with advancement in Information and Communication Technologies, use of real-time data in accurately predicting bus arrival time are widely applied with the hope to improve the operational efficiency. The models discussed in the literature review falls short of capturing the cyclic variation in traffic data like the time of day or day of week also the effect of weather on traffic. In this paper the authors are proposing a model that can account of the changing condition both in short and long term [3]. Predicting bus time arrivals is by no means an easy task. It depends on a lot of factors - time of the day, traffic, the number of passengers getting on and off, weather, proximity of other buses. Thankfully, the MTA has an app called the MTA Bus Time App that does a great job providing time estimates for all routes. But how accurate are these estimates? Is there a systematic error to these predictions (i.e. the times are consistently overestimated)? How certain can we be on these predictions (i.e. can we quantify the distribution of bus time arrivals)? These are questions that I seek to answer in this project.
