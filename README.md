### Problem Context:
NYC MTA Bus agency boasts of largest network of public buses than any other public agency in North America. The bus services are offered 24 hours a day and includes different kinds of services such as local, limited-stop, select bus and express to help city residents commute easily and effectively [1]. In middle of 2015, NYC Bus MTA agency launched Bus Time service that provides time-based bus arrival estimates in addition to distance-based information at any given stop citywide. Surely this kind of system which provides prediction of Bus arrival time is quite useful especially in NYC where city residents heavily rely on public transportation, and this kind of predictive information before hand helps them to plan their trips more efficiently. Bus Time service is possible due to the advancements in Information and Communication Technologies and it uses location data provided by an enhanced global positioning device mounted inside each bus which is further integrated with bus route info, schedules and map files to output the information received by bus customers [2]. On the other hand, according to the NYC's Comptroller audit report on MTA Bus operations, almost 30% of the time the city's express services are late. Additionally, majority of bus complaints made by the customers are due to lateness and delays as shown in the below image [3].

One of the reasons to launch the Bus Time service was a committment from NYC MTA Bus agency to address the delayness problem that is existing in current services and also with the hope to improve their operational efficiencies. Currently, Bus Time service offers information about time estimates of a bus's arrival at a queried stop. These time-based estimates take into consideration multiple factors that can affect the arrival time of a bus, such as its schedule, historical travel times, and current traffic conditions. Additionally there are other factors including cyclic variations like time of the day and day of the week, bus dwell time at any given stop and changing weather conditions. In this project, a new framework will be explored to predict the bus arrival times using the earlier discussed factors and then compared with estimates currently predicted by the Bus Time service used by NYC MTA agency. Specifically, the following questions will be addressed: 

__1.__ How accurate are the estimates?
__2.__ 

Thankfully, the MTA has an app called the MTA Bus Time App that does a great job providing time estimates for all routes. But how accurate are these estimates? Is there a systematic error to these predictions (i.e. the times are consistently overestimated)? How certain can we be on these predictions (i.e. can we quantify the distribution of bus time arrivals)? These are questions that I seek to answer in this project.
